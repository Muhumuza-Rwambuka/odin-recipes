        <li>1/4 cup blanched slivered almonds</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol class="list-of-steps">
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 10 inch <br>
            round cake pan.</li>

        <li>In a medium bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light. Stir in the <br>
            flour and mix until the mixture is mealy. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well <br>
            after each addition. Combine the baking powder and milk, add to the egg <br>
            mixture, mix well. Then combine the lemon juice and baking soda, stir into the <br>
            batter. Pour into the prepared cake pan.</li>

        <li>Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove and sprinkle nuts and <br>
            sugar over the cake, then return it to the oven for 20 to 30 additional minutes, <br>
            until cake springs back to the touch. Gently cut a small hole in the cake and <br>
            place a quarter in the hole. Try to cover the hole with sugar. Cool cake on a rack <br>
            for 10 minutes before inverting onto a plate.</li>

        <li>Serve cake warm. Each person in the family gets a slice starting with the <br>
            youngest. The person who gets the quarter in their piece, gets good luck for the <br>
            whole year!</li>
